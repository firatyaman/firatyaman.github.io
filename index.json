[{"content":"\u003cp\u003eIAB Tech Lab recently published a \u003ca href=\"https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PAIR-Protocol-version-1.0.pdf\"\u003e32 page technical document\u003c/a\u003e about the implementation of PAIR (Publisher Advertiser Identity Reconciliation).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read this, so you don't have to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"1-what-is-pair\"\u003e1. What is PAIR?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePAIR was introduced by Google in 2022 to provide a privacy-first approach to identity resolution between advertisers and publishers. Google then donated this protocol to the IAB Tech Lab to make it a standard for all IAB members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"2-what-do-you-need-to-know-for-now\"\u003e2. What do you need to know, for now?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are responsible for advertising \u0026amp; marketing in your company, whether as a standalone advertiser or publisher, \u003cstrong\u003eyou don\u0026rsquo;t need to take any action\u003c/strong\u003e. The DSP/SSP you are using will implement this protocol into their solution. If you are using a CDP solution to manage your identity graph, you may consider adding a new type of identifier. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that your CDP provider will also guide you regarding possible implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"3-how-does-it-work\"\u003e3. How does it work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe method is based on \u0026ldquo;commutative ciphers\u0026rdquo;. In this method, two parties have their own pair of encryption and decryption keys. They can encrypt/decrypt the data and it will still produce the original message. This property is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple parties need to securely share and access information without a predefined sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormulization:\nPAIR ID = function(raw identifier + advertiser key + publisher key)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can imagine this process as a \u0026lsquo;multi-key safe,\u0026rsquo; similar to the safe rooms in banks. Each advertiser X publisher combo will have a shared safe. To unlock the safe, both advertiser \u0026amp; publisher key must be insert to the key hole to open it.\nEveryone has their own keys and they are unique.\n\u003cimg src=\"multi-key-safe.jpg\" alt='multi key safe' class=\"img-fluid\" width=\"70%\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"steps-to-produce-pair-id\"\u003eSteps to produce PAIR ID\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Each party generates a private key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Each party loads the identifiers to the data clean room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Data clean room generates the PAIR ID by using the formula in a safe environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Data clean room sends the PAIR ID to each party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Data clean room shares the match rate with each party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Each party can now use the PAIR ID to within their DSP/SSP to target the right audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"pair-list-explained.png\" alt='representaion of PAIR list to be used' class=\"img-fluid\" width=\"90%\"\u003e\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNotes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt is the role of the data clean room and DSP/SSP to manage this complexity.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdvertiser private key (Ka) and Publisher private key (Kp) remain constant for a certain time period.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eData clean room aggregates match rates for each party. Publisher and advertiser will receive information on the percentage of their respective data sets that matched. For example, publisher will know that 50% of their data set matched and advertiser will know 30% of their data set matched for a specific matching operation.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt the end of the operation, both parties will get their PAIR IDs next to the raw identifiers for the matching records.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"4-my-take-as-an-end-user-and-an-expert\"\u003e4. My take as an end user and an expert\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt looks fundamentally and technically secure. You know, I have been very concerned about online privacy for a long time. Making PAIR a new standard for identity resolution and achieving mass adoption would give me and everyone who involved a bit of relief.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHowever, the risk will always remain when any party\u0026rsquo;s DCR is compromised, and the key is leaked. But this factor is irrelevant to the PAIR protocol itself. They also mentioned this in the security considerations section.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI would strongly suggest not loading raw identifiers to the DCR. SHA-256 them first and then load these IDs to the DCR. But of course, both parties (advertiser and publisher) must agree on this method first. Otherwise, the IDs won\u0026rsquo;t match.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"5-what-could-be-more\"\u003e5. What could be more?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking user privacy to the next level would occur if login providers like Google, Apple, or Meta decided not to share user email addresses directly with advertisers and publishers. Instead, they could generate random email addresses and link these newly generated addresses to the user\u0026rsquo;s real email address. I would love to see if that happens.\nHowever, this kind of sign-in/registration step with mobile numbers would be much harder to do compared to email addresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"","image":null,"permalink":"https://firatyaman.com/posts/iab-pair-summarized/","title":"IAB PAIR SUMMARIZED: What do you need to know?"},{"content":"\u003ch2 id=\"1-what-is-embedded-gemini-nano\"\u003e1.

I got easily distracted and get bored while writing long paragraphs. The vast majority of my written outputs are quick notes, messaging and short e-mails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to break my lifelong habit and write down the things in a nicely shaped blog posts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some motivations behind this. In the past, I did express my opinions and knowledge on social media. I thought the media I used will last forever. That was wrong. As an example, Facebook was looking immortal to everyone 10 years ago but right now, nobody uses it. There is no guarantee that same thing couldn\u0026rsquo;t happen to Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium and maybe to whole world wide web. Having your own media as the first source of information is always and will be the most reliable option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the social media still exists, I am no longer using any social media (except LinkedIn) for years. I have permanently deleted all my social media accounts due to common privacy concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course, the most important reason is sharing the knowledge. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to share useful information about technology (mostly marketing and data related) from here. It is always better for everyone to write down the things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the upcoming posts, I will also explain the details about how I easily created this website with zero cost and minimal effort. I have also deployed a future-proof data analytics infrastructure behind it. This place is also my sandbox where I perform my expirements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay tuned, moremto come. Love you all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheers.\nFırat Yaman\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://firatyaman.com/posts/my-first-post/","title":"Welcome to my blog"}]
