      <description>Hello Everyone! This is my first ever personal blog post!
During my lifetime I was always a lazy person when it comes to writing. I got easily distracted and get bored while writing long paragraphs. The vast majority of my written outputs are quick notes, messaging and short e-mails.
I decided to break my lifelong habit and write down the things in a nicely shaped blog posts.
There are some motivations behind this.</description>
